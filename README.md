# api-endpoint-tester2
To use the code, follow these steps:

Create a new HTML file using a text editor and copy the provided code into the file.


Save the file with a .html extension (e.g., api_test.html).


Export your Postman collection as a JSON file. In Postman, go to the collection you want to export, click on the three dots (...) next to the collection name, select "Export", and choose "Collection v2.1" format. Save the exported JSON file in the same directory as the HTML file.


Open the HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open With" and choosing your preferred browser.


The web page will display a table with the headers "Endpoint", "Method", "Speed (ms)", "Data Type", and "Security". As the JavaScript code runs, it will test the API endpoints defined in the Postman collection JSON file and populate the table with the test results.


Make sure you have a local server running with the API endpoints you want to test, or replace the example URLs in the code with the correct URLs of your API endpoints.

Please ensure that you have a compatible web browser and a local server set up with the respective API endpoints to get accurate results in the table.
